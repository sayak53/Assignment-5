     <h1>1.What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?</h1>
     <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects, allowing scripts (usually JavaScript) to interact with, manipulate, and update the content, structure, and styling of a web page dynamically. </p>
     <br>
     <h1>2.How do you select an element from the DOM?</h1>
     <p>
        You can select elements from the DOM using several methods provided by JavaScript, depending on the type of selection you need (by ID, class, tag name, or other attributes).Basically five:- 1.getElementsById('id name'). 2.getElementsByClassName('class name'). 3.getElementsByTagName('Tag Name'). 4.querySelector('tag name/.class name/#id name'). 5.querySelectorAll('tag name/.class name/#id name')</p>
     <br>
     <h1>3.What is event delegation in the context of the DOM, and why is it useful?</h1>
     <p>Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript that allows you to manage events more efficiently by taking advantage of event propagation (also known as event bubbling). Instead of adding event listeners to individual child elements, you attach a single event listener to a parent element that can handle events from all its child elements.</p>

     <h1>4.How do you manipulate an element's attributes and styles using the DOM?</h1>
     <p>
        You can manipulate an element's attributes and styles using the DOM in several ways, depending on whether you're targeting attributes (like src, href, etc.) or CSS styles. </p>
